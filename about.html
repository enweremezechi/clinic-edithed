             <h2>Safe, sensitive and discreet.</h2>
             <p class="pin spin">Colon Hydrotherapy aims to rehabilitate and rehydrate your body by naturally 
                and gently flushing out waste, toxins, mucous and parasites. Filtered warm 
                water is introduced via the rectum using closed circuit gravitational pressure. 
                There is no danger whatsoever of bowel perforation and all equipment is either 
                disposable or sterilised ensuring no contamination of viruses, bacteria or fungi.
                The whole process takes between 45 -60 minutes and the modesty of the patient 
                is preserved to the utmost during the session. Unlike the regular use of laxatives, 
                Colon Hydrotherapy is not habit forming and improves the muscle tone of the colon.

             <h2>You’ll feel great again</h2>
             <p class="pin spin">A good colon detox should heal, soothe, repair, and detoxify. With the safe removal
                of their toxin overload, most people immediately experience improved mental clarity,
                a feeling of well-being, lightness and energy, and obvious relief from bloating and
                constipation. Long term, with restoration and improvement of gut bacteria, bowel disease 
                is diminished and, due to improved absorption of nutrients, all-round health is improved. 
                If you have been feeling stressed, fatigued, lethargic or if you suffer from health issues 
                such as IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Leaky Gut Syndrome, Food 
                sensitivities, Indigestion, Bloating/flatulence, Constipation, Candida/other yeast infections,

         <h2>Why don’t you feel as good as you could?</h2>
         <p>Life today is faster, more demanding, time-deprived, and polluted.
          We subject our body and minds to prolonged physical and emotional 
          stress, nutrient poor diets, chemical intervention and, for some, 
          substance abuse. There’s little respite from our busy lives. We become 
          stressed. We seldom, if ever, give our bodies time to replenish and heal. 
          We fast track our “healing” by taking medication for every ailment and, 
         over time, this toxic build up manifests in illness.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="about-blue">
         <h2>How the colon impacts on your health</h2>
         <p>The colon is our emotional seat. It’s the gut-brain 
            connection where good health starts. The colon fulfils 
            a number of vital functions; it completes the digestive 
            process, it is responsible for the elimination of food 
            and other waste and it is the major organ in the excretory 
            system. A normal functioning colon is occupied by billions 
            of healthy bacteria. These bacteria flourish in the intestinal 
            tract – absorbing water soluble nutrients, synthesising vitamins 
            and rallying against infections. In addition, to boost the immune 
            system, the microbiotas send messages to the brain and help regulate 
            metabolism and form colonies to combat obesity, heart disease, 
            autoimmune disease, type 2 diabetes and many other illnesses. When 
            the intestinal ecosystem is disturbed through stress, pollution, 
            poor food and drink choices, pharma and recreational drug use, 
            cigarettes, chemicals, antibiotics and hormones, the bowel ceases 
            to function optimally. This results in a build-up of toxins, 
            faecal matter, gas and mucus deposits, which prevent the colon 
            from ridding the body of poisons. This in turn can cause many 
            of the aforementioned illnesses and ailments.
