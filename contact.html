                 <h3>CANCELLATION POLICY</h3>
                 <p>Your appointments are very important to The Colon Clinic Team,
                     we reserve your time especially for you! We understand that 
                     sometimes you may need to change or adjust your scheduled appointment. 
                     As a courtesy, to us and our other clients, we respectfully request a 
                     24 Hour Notice for cancellations or moving of your booking.
                 </p> <br>
                 <p>Please understand that when you forget or cancel your appointment without 
                     giving us notice, consequently, it means that we miss the opportunity to 
                     assist a client  who may be on our waiting list to receive our services. 
                     Our Cancellation Policy allows us the time to inform our clients on standby 
                     of any availability and to ensure that we provide the best service excellence 
                     to our established and future clients!
                 </p> <br>
                 <p>Our Bookings are confirmed by SMS 24 Hours in advance because we know how easy
                      it is to forget an appointment! Please let us know if your cell phone number 
                       changes so that we can update our records.  As our services are reserved for 
                       you personally, a cancellation fee may apply.
                 </p>
                   <h3 class="cont-sec-h3">SATURDAY BOOKING POLICY</h3>
                   <p>We understand that our lifestyles today do not always allow us to time out 
                       during the week to make scheduled bookings and for this reason our team at 
                       The Colon Clinic offers the convenience of booking your appointments on a 
                       Saturday.
                   </p> <br>
                   <p>In order to secure your booking on a Saturday we do require full payment 
                       of your treatment in advance. Payment can be made in our offices, by Cash, 
                       EFT or by credit card.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>A full non-refundable payment is required. Please note that Cancellations 
                        or non attendance fee of 100% will apply.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>For Saturday bookings a minimum of 24 Hours notice is required to ensure 
                        a refund, or alternatively you can use your payment towards your next treatment.
